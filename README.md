----------
My learning setup:
1. Proxmox on a specific dedicated hardware.
2. First proxmox VM, "100(mainnet)" is created: 8gb ram, 1 socket 4 cores, 1TB of space, Qemu and Ubuntu server default installation.
3. Once the VM starts with Ubuntu server, qemu must be installed in it ``sudo apt update `` ``sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent -y``
